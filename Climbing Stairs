You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

public class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        // Start typing your Java solution below
        // DO NOT write main() function
        
        // f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2);
        if ( n <= 2) return n;
        int a = 2;
        int b = 1;
        for (int i = 3 ; i <= n ; i ++){
            int temp = a;
            a = a + b;
            b = temp;
            
        }
        return a;
        
    }

}
