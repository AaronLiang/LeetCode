Merge Sorted Array May 20 '122331 / 4929
Given two sorted integer arrays A and B, merge B into A as one sorted array.

Note:
You may assume that A has enough space to hold additional elements from B. 
The number of elements initialized in A and B are m and n respectively.

public class Solution {
    public void merge(int A[], int m, int B[], int n) {
        // Start typing your Java solution below
        // DO NOT write main() function
        while(n>0){
        if(m  > 0 &&  A[m-1] > B[n-1])
            A[n+m-1] = A[--m];
        else
            A[n+m-1] = B[--n];
        }
    }
}
